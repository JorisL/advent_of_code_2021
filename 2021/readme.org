#+TITLE: Advent of code 2021

* Description
My (botched) solutions for [[https://adventofcode.com/2021][Advent of Code 2021]], which I used to start learning emacs-lisp, common lisp, and several shell tools (sed, awk, etc.).

Daily solutions are implemented in org-mode documents and executed using org-babel.

Remark: GitHub shows a markup version of the org documents with the text and code blocks, but without results, code block calls, etc.
View the org documents as raw text (or in emacs org-mode) to view those.
